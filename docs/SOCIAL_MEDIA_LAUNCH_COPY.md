🧵 I built an AI that writes marketplace listings from photos. Here's how it works:

1/ Take photos of your item from different angles. That's it. No need for perfect lighting or staged photos.

2/ QuickList AI identifies your item automatically - reads labels, barcodes, and style codes to find the exact product.

3/ It writes a professional description, suggests competitive prices based on real sold listings, and generates SEO keywords.

4/ Download everything as a ZIP - title, description, keywords, images - ready to paste into any marketplace.

5/ Try it free: quicklist.it.com

5 free listings/month. No credit card required.

[Tool] Built an AI that writes marketplace listings from photos - free tier available

Hey r/reselling,

Long-time lurker here. I was spending hours writing descriptions and researching prices, so I built a tool to automate it.

**What it does:**
- Upload photos of your item
- AI identifies it from labels/codes (reads those tiny style numbers on tags)
- Generates title, description, keywords
- Suggests price based on actual sold eBay listings
- Works for Vinted, eBay, Gumtree

**Free tier:**
- 5 listings per month
- No credit card required

Would love feedback from actual resellers. What features would make your life easier?

Link: quicklist.it.com

Not trying to spam - genuinely built this to solve my own problem and figured others might find it useful.

### r/Vinted Post

[Tool] AI that identifies items and writes Vinted listings - anyone tried this?

Started using QuickList AI for my Vinted listings. You upload photos and it:

- Reads the brand/style codes automatically
- Writes the description
- Suggests hashtags
- Gives pricing based on sold items

Free tier has 5 listings/month. Been using it for a week and it's saved me a ton of time.

Anyone else tried it? Curious what other tools people use for listing faster.

Excited to share what I've been building 🚀

QuickList AI helps people turn their unwanted items into marketplace listings in seconds.

The reselling market is booming - £3.2B+ on Vinted alone last year - but the biggest barrier to entry is the time it takes to create good listings.

Our AI:
→ Identifies products from photos (reading labels, codes, tags)
→ Writes professional, SEO-optimized descriptions
→ Suggests competitive prices based on real market data
→ Generates platform-specific keywords

The goal: Make selling as easy as taking photos.
